               <h1>Leon Amponsah</h1>
               <p> I am Leon. I currently study
                at <strong>Birmingham City University</strong>. I have a passion for computing. It began not too long ago. First time i started to take interest was in 2020 when covid began.
                Since then i have gotten used to the different programming languages in computing. I am comfortble with python and HTML as i have been learning them on myown.
                I have done projects using the python language as this is one of the main languages that was used in my course that i am studying.
                Furthermore i have an in depth knowlege in different iperating systems such as linux and windows.

                <p>
                    Python – I designed a calculator and designed a banking system which had features such as deposit, giving the admin privileges to be able to change the customer’s personal details.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Linux – I learned to configure the network settings as well as the basics. E.g installing a package.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WordPress – I used WordPress in my first year to develop a website for my project which was for an organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tinkercard – Used tinkercard to develop my c++ as it was a guide and I replicated that into my final project which was to make a security box and my team used the c++.
